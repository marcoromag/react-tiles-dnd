A tile manager for React that supports

- dynamic grid: if the viewport resizes, you can shrink the grid size or shrink the number of columns and rows
- tiles in multiple sizes: each tile can span an arbitrary number of columns and rows of the grid
- drag and drop, both for reorder and for dropping one tile in another
